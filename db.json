    "Description": "Studio features rustic aesthetics reminiscent of the industrial era. These industrial pieces emphasise on the brushed and saw cut Acacia wood with bold and textured dark metal frames. Applying a modern twist to a nostalgic style, the wood is finished in a distressed mocha grey colour, making it easily adaptable to other interior design styles.    The differential element of the Studio Dining Table is the original use of metal with a rough industrial finishing. With a bold textured design, they follow the industrial trend that is marking today's living trends.",
