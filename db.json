    "Description": "Studio features rustic aesthetics reminiscent of the industrial era. These industrial pieces emphasise on the brushed and saw cut Acacia wood with bold and textured dark metal frames. Applying a modern twist to a nostalgic style, the wood is finished in a distressed mocha grey colour, making it easily adaptable to other interior design styles.    The differential element of the Studio Dining Table is the original use of metal with a rough industrial finishing. With a bold textured design, they follow the industrial trend that is marking today's living trends.
    *This collection is made of Acacia wood in distressed saw cut mocha grey finish - a textured finish that incorporates the unique characteristics of knots, cracks, grain variations and colour differences into each piece. Due to the characteristics of the finish, Studio will have worn edges, wood contours, uneven planks and dents. ",
